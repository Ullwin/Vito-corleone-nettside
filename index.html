        <h1> OUR STORY</h1>
        <p>When the Naples-born Cantalupo family first opened their restaurant in San Francisco's North Beach in 1935, it brought the first wood-fired brick oven to the West Coast and served closely-guarded Neapolitan recipes that their family had been passing down for generations. <br> <br>
Decades of success later, the Crotti family took over ownership and vowed to continue the tradition of delicious food and the warm, family-focused Italian hospitality that the Cantalupos had build their foundation on. Whether it's the fresh antipasto, classic lasagna, or famous wood-fired brick oven pizza, pair it with a glass of wine and you'll taste the tradition in every sip and bite! <br> <br>
