      <h1>Accessibility report</h1>
      <p>
        When we started building this project, the first thing we did was to
        read the material linked in the assignment. We read all about SEO and
        user accessibility and implemented it to the best of our ability, all
        while embarking on making our first website and working as a team
        together for the first time. We tried to implement good SEO, and
        researched keywords for the website like “restaurant” “Italian” “menu”
        and the area it should be visible in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we read about how to upload a sitemap of our webpage to google to
        get crawled, and tried to build our frontpage good enough to get indexed
        by google. After that we carefully linked all the pages of our webpage,
        to ensure that all the pages were internally linked and no page ended up
        orphaned. The website setup started out as a mess, since none of us had
        any knowledge of how to make a clean and organized page, and at the same
        time work with CSS to make it look and feel seamless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessibility was our main focus making this page. Since there is a lot
        to learn and do to ensure accessibility for all, the job would be too
        big for us to implement all at once, so we decided to focus on people
        using screen readers, and people using keyboard navigation. To ensure
        accessibility for these groups, we downloaded the chrome extension
        “Screen reader by google chrome” which helped us understand how people
        using screen readers experience and interact with the internet. We used
        the text-to-speech function to learn how our website could be further
        improved, along with playing around with the keyboard navigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this process, we visited a lot of different websites to try to
        experience the difficulties people with screen readers and keyboard
        users come across to access universal information. Some pages were easy
        to navigate, while some, even important government websites, were almost
        impossible to navigate to get the information you were after. After
        using the knowledge we gathered to try to make our website as easy to
        navigate as possible. We were deeply affected by the challenges
        accessibility pose, especially for the elderly population. One of us has
        a visually impaired grandparent that is dependent on this service every
        day, which we had in mind throughout our project. This challenge really
        motivated and inspired us to work with and ensure accessibility in our
        future projects both at university and when we eventually enter the
        workforce.
      </p>
      <p>
        After we were done with the HTML and CSS we used an online accessibility
        checker to validate our website. According to the accessibility check we
        had five errors that needed correction. We found out that we had a
        floating &lt;/div&gt; that did nothing. We also found that our buttons
        shouldn’t be placed inside the &lt;a&gt; element, but rather have the
        button as its own element with &lt;button onclick&gt;. This problem
        occurred twice in the code in two different HTML files. After resolving
        the problems the accessibility checker made us aware of, we put our
        website through the website accessibility checker once more to see if it
        found any other errors. It pointed out that there was another error that
        we created when we resolved the other issues with our site, after fixing
        this problem as well the validator reported no issues with the site. As
        it did not point out any further issues we concluded that the website
        had reached its full potential. The site is by no means perfect, and a
        professional may have made a better one in less than a minute. But in
        the end, we were happy with the results, but most of all the personal
        and team progress we made by this challenge.
